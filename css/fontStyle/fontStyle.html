    To change font type in HTML, use the CSS font-family property. 
    Set it to the value you want and place it inside a style attribute. 
    Then add this style attribute to an HTML element, like a paragraph, heading, button, or span tag.
    This is how you use inline CSS. Inline CSS means your HTML and CSS will be placed together in the body 
    section of your HTML doc. So, technically, you’ll be changing font “in HTML.”
    You used to be able to simply use the font tag to change the style of text in HTML. 
    So say you wanted to change your font to Arial, size 20px, and a nice orange color. 
    You would have written the following line of HTML:
    </p>
</body>
</html>
